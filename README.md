# Comments
A WIP program to cut and paste pieces of text to generate teacher comments based on a few prompts.

Version 1.1
Added the ability to pull data from google sheets to populate comment variables.

To Do: 
- Prompt user for which window they want to generate comments for. 
    - The program should then populate the variables with the appropriate content from the google sheet.
- Create a gui for ease of use.
- Create a way for people to link to their own google sheets to make the program usable by anyone.
