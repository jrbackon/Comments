# Comments
A WIP program to cut and paste pieces of text to generate teacher comments based on a few prompts.

Version 1.0
The program requires manual input of boiler plates and grade templates directly into the code for a given window.

To Do: 
- Prompt user for which window they want to generate comments for. 
    - The program should then populate the variables with the appropriate content from the google sheet.
- Create a gui for ease of use.
- Create a way for people to link to their own google sheets to make the program usable by anyone.
